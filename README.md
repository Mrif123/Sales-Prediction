# 📈  Sales Forecast Trends Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project involves designing a Sales Forecast Trends Prediction Model to predict the number of sales using Machine Learning algorithms. The model leverages Linear Regression to analyze historical sales data and predict future trends.

🔍 Key Objectives:

Predict the number of sales using Linear Regression.

Enhance data understanding through various visualizations.

Gain deeper insights by leveraging Power BI.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

🔹 Machine Learning & Data Processing

Python 🐍

Linear Regression 📉

📊 Data Visualization

Matplotlib 📈

Seaborn 🎨

Power BI ⚡

📊 Data Visualizations

To better understand the dataset, multiple visualization techniques were used:

Pairplot 🔗 - To identify relationships between variables.

Scatter Plot 📌 - To observe data distribution.

Bar Plot 📊 - To compare categorical data.

Pie Chart 🥧 - To analyze proportions.

📊 Power BI Dashboard

To gain greater insights, the dataset was visualized in Power BI and transformed into an interactive report pinned to a dashboard.

📌 Below is the attached dashboard with the pinned report:
