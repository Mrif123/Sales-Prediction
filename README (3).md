# 🚗 3D Car Animation using OpenGL

## 🎨 Project Overview
Computer graphics enable the creation of 3D models of real or imaginary objects, and this project showcases a **3D Car Animation** built using **OpenGL in Code Blocks**.

This project offers various interactive functions:
- **🚘 Car Model Mode**: Displays a 3D car moving in different directions.
- **🛣️ Car Driving Mode**: Allows the car to move **forward and backward**.
- **🎡 Wheel Rotation**: The wheels rotate **realistically** as the car moves.
- **🎨 Color Customization**: Change the car's color to **red, blue, green, black, yellow, or grey**.
- **🌞🌙 Day & Night Modes**: Enhance realism with different lighting effects.
- **💡 Toggle Light Function**: Adjust the **brightness intensity** in both day and night modes.

Through the use of **powerful OpenGL functions**, this project delivers **realistic visuals** and captivating effects, making it an engaging experience for users interested in **computer graphics and animation**.
